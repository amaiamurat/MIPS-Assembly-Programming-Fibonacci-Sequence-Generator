# MIPS-Fibonacci-Project

This project implements a MIPS program that repeatedly prompts the user for an integer *N* until a valid value (≥ 22) is entered. Once a legal input is provided, the program computes and prints the first N Fibonacci numbers using MIPS instructions, starting from 0 and 1. The program is designed to run correctly under SPIM simulator.
